# Google Homepage Replica
# I created a replica (or as close as possible to a replica) of the Google Homepage using what I have learned so far from The Odin Project, Springboard, and Bento.

# This project is my second official front-end project I completed as a beginner. It was the first task from The Odin Project's Web Development 101 >> The Front End >> Project: HTML/CSS section. I did all the coding by hand without use of a framework so it is not entirely responsive. Visually, it gets the job done and I think it would be pretty easy to fool anyone at first glance. 

I did have some trouble centering the logo, search bar, and search buttons and I had a 'doh moment because I forgot you cannot apply margin: 0 auto; to inline elements. To bypass this, I applied display: table; margin: auto; to the div element. There are many other ways to do this and this way made the most sense for me as a beginner. 

I am one month into learning how to code-front end and I am happy with my results so far. I am excited to see what else I'll learn!
